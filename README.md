DATA  ANALYTICS AND VISUALISATION USING ADIDAS SALES DATASET

# Overview

This project is a comprehensive end-to-end data analytics and business intelligence solution built using the Adidas sales dataset. It began with selecting a relevant business domain and identifying key stakeholders, business requirements, and goals. A dimensional model was designed and implemented using SQL Server to create a Data Warehouse/Data Mart, supported by ETL processes to populate and maintain it. The data was thoroughly explored, cleaned, and prepared for analysis using SQL and Python, applying various data analytics techniques for insight generation and model evaluation.

In the modeling phase, multiple machine learning algorithms were applied, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Among these, the Random Forest algorithm showed the most consistent performance across both "Active" and "Inactive" classes. However, when evaluating by class, Linear Regression and Decision Tree performed best for the "Active" class, while KNN was most effective for the "Inactive" class. This hands-on experience significantly deepened my understanding of data mining operations, from exploratory analysis and data processing to building and evaluating predictive models, and helped me sharpen my machine learning skills.

Interactive visualizations were created using Tableau, and structured operational reports were developed using SSRS to support business decision-making. The project highlights a strong focus on real-world business needs, combining data modeling, ETL pipelines, analytics, and dashboard/report development to deliver actionable insights.
